## Components
- 1 x Arduino UNO
- 2 x servo motors
- 1 x TCS320 color sensor
- 1 x support made from cardbord
- wires
- 3D printed pieces

## Idea

The top servo moves the candy received from the funnel in front of the color sensor in order to be analyzed. The bottom servo is then moved and the candy slides into the coresponding container.
